<p>A period of sixteen years having elapsed since an edition of Local Songs
was published in a collective form, and that volume having been for some
time out of print, renders almost superfluous any apology in presenting
the following collection to the public. During the last few years, so
great has been the progress of education amongst the humbler classes of
society, that many of those eccentricities so often seized upon by our
Local Poets as subjects of humourous satire, are fast disappearing, and
ere many more years shall have elapsed, the Songs of our Local Bards
will be the only memorials of the peculiar characteristics of this
ancient border town.</p>

<p>Should an occasional coarseness of language meet the eye, let not the
fastidious reader forget, that such were the modes of expression used by
the parties described, and that elegance of language would be as much
out of place as are the polished classical sentences of Shenstone's
rustics, so often and so justly a theme of censure.</p>

<p>The Publishers beg to tender their best thanks to the several
respectable individuals who have so kindly favoured them with the many
original pieces which appear in this volume; and regret that the limited
space for an address prevents a more personal allusion, than referring
<span class="pagenum">[Pg v]</span>the reader to their names in the table of contents.</p><br>

person, for some time, laudably exerted himself to oppose the claims of
the Government Clergy to what are called Easter dues or offerings; and
by a powerful appeal to the public, succeeded in convincing many that
such claims were equally oppressive and unjust, and founded neither in
the law nor the gospel.&mdash;The late worthy Vicar of Newcastle, Mr. John
Smith, actuated with the generous feelings of a Man and a Christian, and
with due deference to public opinion, restrained the Clergy in his
jurisdiction from collecting these Exactions during the latter
years of his life. To him, therefore, and to Peter Watson, in
particular, who aroused the public attention to the subject, the
inhabitants of Newcastle are indebted for being relieved from this
odious, unjust, and oppressive Clerical Tax.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 135]</span></p></div>

<span class="i2">O Jockey, my friend, mun, how last you this evening?<br></span>
<span class="i2">Come in, crook your hough, and let's hear all your news;<br></span>
<span class="i2">It appears to me you have been tramping this morning,<br></span>
<span class="i2">I see by the dust that's so thick on your shoes.<br></span>
<span class="i2">I have been a tramping, I've been at Newcastle,<br></span>
<span class="i2">All the things I have seen there my memory can't bring;<span class="pagenum">[Pg 199]</span><br></span>
<span class="i2">The folks from all parts have rais'd such a noration,<br></span>
<span class="i2">About the Coronation of Geordy the King.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The first thing I saw was two fires for the bullocks&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i2">They hung them both down as it struck twelve at night;<br></span>
<span class="i2">But lang ere day-light was come in on the morning,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Both stuffing and 'tatoes were burnt in their kites.<br></span>
<span class="i2">They turn'd them on spite until burnt like two cinders,<br></span>
<span class="i2">And cut them both up about twelve of the day;<br></span>
<span class="i2">As they lay on the stages, they smok'd just like tinder,<br></span>
<span class="i2">And look'd like two muck-heaps, the people did say.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Then the carvers set to with knives cutting and scraping,<br></span>
<span class="i2">And lumps of fat beef with such vengeance were strew'd,<br></span>
<span class="i2">I dare say they thought that the folks were all gaping,<br></span>
<span class="i2">And believ'd they were feeding a swine multitude.<br></span>
<span class="i2">But the stuff they threw out put the folks in a fury,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Both stones and brick-bats they snatch'd up in a rage;<br></span>
<span class="i2">And a radical troop, thus equipp'd in a hurry,<br></span>
<span class="i2">With vengeance bang'd carvers and beef off the stage.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">For the folks being determin'd, the beef would not handle,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Nor gobble it up like a stye full of swine;<br></span>
<span class="i2">For their conscience did whisper it would be a scandal:<br></span>
<span class="i2">So the stuff was refus'd by the sons of the Tyne.<br></span>
<span class="i2">The next thing I saw was a British young sailor,<br></span>
<span class="i2">He pull'd the crown down from the top of the crane;<br></span>
<span class="i2">Although with brick bats he got many a nailor,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Yet he stuck up a label concerning the Queen.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">This bill being put up set the crowd in a motion,<br></span>
<span class="i2">They gave three times three when first it was seen;<br></span>
<span class="i2">And loudly did praise the brave tars of the ocean,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Who fought in defence of their much injur'd Queen.<br></span>
<span class="i2">These things being done, it rais'd such a durdem,<br></span>
<span class="i2">The stones and the brick-bats flew up like a cloud:<br></span>
<span class="i2">A poor Tyne Cossack, that belong'd to Tom Burdon,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Was near crush'd to death as he fought with the crowd.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">That day in the town was heard no sound of bugles,<br></span>
<span class="i2">And Bold Archy, he too was ne'er seen iv a';<span class="pagenum">[Pg 200]</span><br></span>
<span class="i2">For if that but once he had brought down the Noodles,<br></span>
<span class="i2">They'd been trod under foot like a bundle of straw.<br></span>
<span class="i2">For so bold are the men about canny Newcassel,<br></span>
<span class="i2">No injustice they'll suffer when assembled a':<br></span>
<span class="i2">If the King had been there he'd ne'er worn his gold tassel,<br></span>
<span class="i2">And as to being crown'd, that would ne'er done iv a'.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The things that were flying appear'd like a battle;<br></span>
<span class="i2">So, afraid of being fell'd, as I stood by the folks,<br></span>
<span class="i2">I on shankie nagie away straight did rattle,<br></span>
<span class="i2">To drag down the street the black bones of the ox.<br></span>
<span class="i2">When I came to the Sandhill my eyes I got open'd,<br></span>
<span class="i2">I saw something standing which brightly did shine;<br></span>
<span class="i2">A large wooden Pant, and a crown on the top o't:<br></span>
<span class="i2">When I came to look close it was running red wine,<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The folk that were round it appear'd to be growling<br ></span>
<span class="i2">And fighting amongst it like so many cats;<br></span>
<span class="i2">While others I saw among mud and dirt rolling,<br></span>
<span class="i2">And drinking the wine out of old lousy hats.<br></span>
<span class="i2">Thinks I to myself, this is all botheration,<br></span>
<span class="i2">It is but a pretext, I know by their scheme,<br></span>
<span class="i2">To pump out what's left of the wealth of the nation,<br></span>
<span class="i2">To swell the fat bags of the Clergy and King.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The next thing I saw that took up my attention,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Was a keelman quite nak'd! he'd no breeches iv a';<br></span>
<span class="i2">Some said he, for fighting, deserv'd well a pension,<br></span>
<span class="i2">But I think that he ought to've been tried by the law.<br></span>
<span class="i2">The wives that were running fell o'er, tappy lappy,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Town serjeants the keelmen did pelt well with glare;<br></span>
<span class="i2">And swore, if they could but catch Tripy and Cappy,<br></span>
<span class="i2">They would tear them to rags at the end of the war.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Then I by this time nigh got into a quarrel;<br></span>
<span class="i2">I argued, but could not the battle decide;<br></span>
<span class="i2">So dreading some person might tear my apparel,<br></span>
<span class="i2">I took my departure unto the Quayside.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 201]</span><br></span>
<span class="i2">In going down the Quay there was such a crushing&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i2">I met with a man of the name of Tom Dale,<br></span>
<span class="i2">He said, into Sandgate the folks were all pushing,<br></span>
<span class="i2">For the Pant on the hill there was running strong ale.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">When I got to Sandgate I could not help laughing,<br></span>
<span class="i2">The lasses were running about with the swipes;<br></span>
<span class="i2">And old wives that fell in the gutter were scruffling,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Ne'er minded, but smok'd on their old cutty pipes.<br></span>
<span class="i2">I next took my journey as for as the 'Spital,<br></span>
<span class="i2">To see if ought curious was there to be seen;<br></span>
<span class="i2">But I think that from Sandgate it differed little,<br></span>
<span class="i2">For the folks were all drinking the health of the Queen.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">I went to an alehouse, and nearly got fuddled,<br></span>
<span class="i2">For by walking about sae my legs were quite lame;<br></span>
<span class="i2">So on my old pins then away I straight toddled,<br></span>
<span class="i2">And ne'er look'd behind me, but tramp'd away hame.<br></span>
<span class="i2">At Newcastle there have been both horse and boat races,<br></span>
<span class="i2">I have droll things to tell you, if I had but time;<br></span>
<span class="i2">But having to call at some more bits of places,<br></span>
<span class="i2">On some other day I will finish my rhyme.<br></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">To London they came, through the high road to fame,<br></span>
<span class="i4">Their hearts were both merry and staunch:<br></span>
<span class="i2">Of success confident, to the Treasury they went,<br></span>
<span class="i4">And demanded they might have a Branch!<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">False report (only guess) brought to Gotham success,<br></span>

<span class="i4">A Gull flying back with a Branch in his mouth.<br></span>
<span class="i2">The news quickly spread; they, in wild consternation,<br></span>
<span class="i4">Burnt tar-barrels, bells ringing, dancing for joy;<br></span>
<span class="i2">A person was sent for to plan the foundation,<br></span>

<span class="i4">Ran foul of a quaker, and knock'd off his hat.<br></span>
<span class="i2">A full brandy bottle came smack through a window,<br></span>

<span class="i2">Their Gull-eye at London, o'er pudding and roast,<br></span>

<span class="i4">"That grass might soon grow upon Newcassel Kee."<br></span>
<span class="i2">But the Treas'ry decision laid vap'ring aside;<br></span>
<span class="i4">"No Branch!" was the cry, so away the Gulls slunk:<br></span>
<span class="i2">Should a Twig be lopp'd off, it can ne'er be deny'd,<br></span>
<span class="i4">But the roots would soon dry, and thus wither its trunk.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">So now I've a scheme, if your fancy I hit,<br></span>
<span class="i4">'Twill suit crazy folks, after dancing mad reels;<br></span>
<span class="i2">Instead of a Custom-house Branch, 'twould be fit<br ></span>
<span class="i4">That a Branch from the Mad-house be rear'd in North Shields.<br></span>
<span class="i2">We'll laugh at the joke, while experience may learn<br ></span>
<span class="i4">The Gulls, for the future, in peace to remain.<br></span>
<span class="i2">By what you have heard, you may also discern,<br></span>

old Margery Gray, which took place about October, 1831, this tub was

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_51_51" id="Footnote_51_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> Some years ago, a spring of water was observed to ooze
from the bank at the foot of Sandyford Dean, to which some people
attributed medicinal qualities; but it was not generally noticed till
the spring of 1841, when its fame spread abroad, and drew the attention
of multitudes of people to the spot, many of whom being afflicted with
complaints of long standing, after drinking freely of this water,
declared themselves cured; and some of the faculty proving its qualities
by analyzation, gave it a more favourable report, which caused still
greater numbers of invalids, &amp;c. to visit the spring&mdash;some with casks
and cans, others with jugs and bottles, anxiously waiting for a turn.
Whether the benefits said to have been received from this water were
real or imaginary, time, the test of all things, will assuredly prove.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
